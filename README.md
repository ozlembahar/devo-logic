# Computational logical model of embryonic neurogenesis

The computational model integrates the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Hedgehog (Hh) and Wingless (Wnt/Wg) signaling pathways using a logical framework.
The model provides a mechanistic understanding of the underlying signaling- and gene regulatory mechanisms controlling embryonic nervous system development.
The model analysis pipeline was carried out GINsim's Python module and consists of two main steps:

1. Analysis of the wild-type model
2. Perturbation analysis: Double mutation and ectopic pathway activation
